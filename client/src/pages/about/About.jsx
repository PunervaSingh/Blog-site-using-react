                            <br />
                            Let me Introduce myself first...
                            <br />
                            I am Punerva, founder/creator of splog.
                            <br />
                            I made this site with a lot of love ðŸ’œ so that you guyz can enjoy it thouroughly.
                            <br/>
                            I am Indian and currently {new Date().getFullYear()-2002} years old.
                            <br /> 
                            I am an undergraduate from Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women pursuing my Bachelor of technology degree in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. 
                            <br />
                            Yes.. AI but it is more than robots (trust meðŸ˜Œ) and for those who know about it my interest is in machine learning aspect of it. 
                            <br />
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p style={{letterSpacing:"1px",lineHeight:"20px"}}>
                            Along with it I also enjoy Web development immensely and create sites just like the one you are currently on.
                            <br />
                            I aim to develop environment friendly technology that will help humans to live their life with more comfort and take care of the environment.
                            <br />
                            In my free time I love to dance, sing, cook, read book, paint, sketch and the one thing which I love to do the most is sleep. But I rarely get free time...
                            <br />
                            It's okay I guess as APJ Abdul Kalam once said "Man needs difficulties in life because they are necessary to enjoy the success".
                            <br />
                            With that said I will leave you guyz to enjoy splog and don't forget to share this site with other people around you.
